Introduction
-------------

**FeedRadar.IO** is an **open access** platform created in order to share freely and widely
ressources concerning data mining, data science, machine learning, computer vision and so on.
I really hope this platform will become a *must-see* for every student in data science and but
also for data analysts and data scientists.

In order to widely open access to the ressources, the platform provides an **API** access.
It's free to use, you just need an API Key which is available upon request at : contact (at) feedradar (dot) io.

If you need any specific method to crawl the platform, feel free to contact me.
I'll be glad to provide some help for your projects.

**Our Motto :** *Keep Sharing and Spreading Knowledge*
