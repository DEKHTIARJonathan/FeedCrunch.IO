	* Change KZ_BACKEND_PATHS to KEYCZAR_BACKEND_PATHS

2011-12-29 17:13:12 +1100 Robert Leftwich

	* Fix for a long-standing issue with the crypter passed to the
	encrypted reader being an Encrypter, not a Crypter capable of
	decrypting any existing keys. Refactored creation of Crypter for
	encrypted keysets to a single function for reuse and ease of
	testing.

2011-12-29 17:06:53 +1100 Robert Leftwich

	* Fix issue with FileReader and StaticKeyReader assuming that they
	work for every location. Added unit tests for CreateReader and
	CreateWriter. Made CreateReader/Writer error messages a little
	more explicit.

2011-12-29 17:03:23 +1100 Robert Leftwich

	* Added the ability to specify paths to additional backends using
	an environment variable.

	* Rationalised crypter_test.py permutations to improve unit test
	performance. Added missing import to keyczar.py and a test for it.

	* Add streaming encryption and decryption support and
	tests. Separate Base64 encoding from streaming
	encryption/decryption. Added Base64 streaming
	encoding/decoding. Allow default Base64 encoding/decoding on
	encrypt/decrypt to be overridden. Renamed util.Decode/Encode to
	util.Base64Decode/Base64Encode and added deprecation
	wrappers. Tweaks to unit test setup to remove use of undocumented
	makeSuite().  Changed util.Decode() to remove line endings to
	handle reflowed input data. Added tests for simulated reflowed
	data. Sundry style guide fixes to old and new code. Added
	util_test.py with tests for Base64 streaming.

	* Fix Python signed session encryption.  It was erroneously base64
	encoding the ciphertext before signing, making it incompatible
	with the other language implementations.

2011-12-02 14:49:43 -0700 Shawn Willden

	* Made base 64 encoding optional for encryption and decryption.

2011-12-02 14:39:51 -0700 Shawn Willden

	* Renamed Encode and Decode to Base64WSEncode and Base64WSDecode.

2011-11-27 16:15:58 +1100 Robert Leftwich

	* Added support for pluggable backends, allowing key sets to be
	stored outside the local file system. Kept Keyczar.Write backward
	compatible, allowing but deprecating use of a string instead of a
	Writer.

2011-12-01 22:22:19 -0700 Shawn Willden

	* Added signed session encryption and decryption to Python.

2011-12-01 22:17:07 -0700 Shawn Willden

	* Added attached signing and verification to Python.

2011-12-01 22:09:54 -0700 Shawn Willden

	* Added session encryption to Keyczar Python.

2011-11-27 09:29:25 +1100 Robert Leftwich

	* Add initial support for M2Crypto, allowing switching between it
	and PyCrypto as required. Changed tests to run in both modes and
	added an interop test of varying key sizes.

2011-12-01 00:41:52 -0700 Shawn Willden

	* Added an assertion to ensure no one tries to create non CBC-mode
	AES keys, since we don't actually support them.
