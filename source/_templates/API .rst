API Documentation
================================

Now that we have our basic skeleton,
let's document the project.
As you might have guessed from the name,
we'll be documenting a basic web crawler.

For this project,
we'll have the following pages:

* Index Page
* Support
* Installation
* Cookbook
* Command Line Options
* API

Let's go over the concepts we'll cover,
and then we can talk more about the pages to create.

Concepts
********

Sections
--------

.. code-block:: rst

   Title
   =====

   Section
   -------

   Subsection
   ~~~~~~~~~~

Every Sphinx document has multiple level of headings.
Section headers are created by underlining
the section title with a punctuation character, at least
as long as the text.

They give structure to the document,
which is used in navigation and in the display in all output formats.

Code Samples
------------

.. code-block:: rst

   You can use ``backticks`` for showing ``highlighted`` code.

If you want to make sure that text is shown in monospaced fonts for code examples or concepts,
use double backticks arond it.
It looks ``like this`` on output.

Hyperlink Syntax
----------------

.. code-block:: rst

   `A cool website`_

   .. _A cool website: http://sphinx-doc.org

The link text is set by putting a ``_`` after some text.
The ````` is used to group text,
allowing you to include multiple words in your link text.
You should use the `````,
even when the link text is only one word.
This keeps the syntax consistent.

The link target is defined at the bottom of the section with ``.. _<link text>: <target>``.

.. index::
   pair: Syntax; Code Example

Code Example Syntax
-------------------

.. code-block:: rst

   A cool bit of code::

      Some cool Code

   .. code-block:: rst

      A bit of **rst** which should be *highlighted* properly.

The syntax for displaying code is ``::``.
When it is used at the end of a sentence,
Sphinx is smart and displays one ``:`` in the output,
and knows there is a code example in the following indented block.

Sphinx,
like Python,
uses meaningful whitespace.
Blocks of content are structured based on the indention level they are on.
You can see this concept with our ``code-block`` directive later.

.. index::
   pair: Syntax; TOC Tree

.. _toctree-syntax:

Table of Contents Tree
----------------------

.. code-block:: rst

  .. toctree::
     :maxdepth: 2

     install
     support

Now would be a good time to introduce the ``toctree``.
One of the main concepts in Sphinx is that it allows multiple pages to be combined into a cohesive hierarchy.
The ``toctree`` directive is a fundamental part of this structure.

The above example will output a Table of Contents in the page where it occurs.
The ``maxdepth`` argument tells Sphinx to include 2 levels of headers in it's output.
It will output the 2 top-level headers of the pages listed.
This also tells Sphinx that the other pages are sub-pages of the current page,
creating a "tree" structure of the pages::

    index
    ├── install
    ├── support

.. note:: The TOC Tree is also used for generating the navigation elements inside Sphinx.
          It is quite important,
          and one of the most powerful concepts in Sphinx.

Tasks
*****

Create Installation page
------------------------

Installation documentation is really important.
Anyone who is coming to the project will need to install it.
For our example,
we are installing a basic Python script,
so it will be pretty easy.

Include the following in your ``install.rst``,
on the same level as ``index.rst``, properly marked up:

.. literalinclude:: crawler/docs/step1/install.txt
   :linenos:

.. note::
   Live Preview: :doc:`crawler/docs/step1/install`

You can now open the ``support.html`` file directly,
but it isn't showing on the navigation..

Create Support page
-------------------

It's always important that users can ask questions when they get stuck.
There are many ways to handle this,
but normal approaches are to have an IRC channel and mailing list.

Go ahead and put this in your ``support.rst``, but add the proper RST markup:

.. literalinclude:: crawler/docs/step1/support.txt
   :linenos:

.. note::
   Live Preview: :doc:`crawler/docs/step1/support`

Add TocTree
-----------

Now you need to tie all these files together.
As we mentioned above,
the :ref:`toctree-syntax` is the best way to do this.
Go ahead and complete the ``toctree`` directive in your ``index.rst`` file,
adding the new ``install`` and ``support``.

Sanity Check
------------

Your filesystem should now look something like this::

    crawler
    ├── src
    └── docs
        ├── index.rst
        ├── support.rst
        ├── install.rst
        ├── Makefile
        ├── conf.py

Build Docs
----------

Now that you have a few pages of content,
go ahead and build your docs again::

  make html

If you open up your ``index.html``,
you should see the basic structure of your docs from the included ``toctree`` directive.

Extra Credit
************

Have some extra time left?
Check out these other cool things you can do with Sphinx.

Make a manpage
---------------

The beauty of Sphinx is that it can output in multiple formats,
not just HTML.
All of those formats share the same base format though,
so you only have to change things in one place.
So you can generate a manpage for your docs::

  make man

This will place a manpage in ``_build/man``.
You can then view it with::

  man _build/man/crawler.1

Create a single page document
-----------------------------

Some people prefer one large HTML document,
instead of having to look through multiple pages.
This is another area where Sphinx shines.
You can write your documentation in multiple files to make editing and updating easier.
Then if you want to distribute a single page HTML version::

  make singlehtml

This will combine all of your HTML pages into a single page.
Check it out by opening it in your browser::

    open _build/singlehtml/index.html

.. note:: You'll notice that it included the documents in the order
          that your :ref:`TOC Tree <toctree-syntax>` was defined.

Play with RST
-------------

RST takes a bit of practice to wrap your head around.
Go over to http://rst.ninjs.org,
which is a live preview.

.. note:: Use the :doc:`cheatsheet` for lots more ideas!

Looking for some ideas of what the syntax contains?
The :ref:`rst-primer` in the Sphinx docs is a great place to start.

..
    Local setup
    ~~~~~~~~~~~

    Want to be able to run this locally?
    Go ahead and clone the repo and get it setup::

       git clone https://github.com/anru/rsted
       cd rsted
       pip install -r pip-requirements.txt
       python application.py

    .. note:: If you already have the repository for this project,
              the ``rsted`` repo should already be in your ``usb`` directory   .

    You can now view the application by going to http://localhost:5000.

Moving on
---------

Now it is time to move on to :doc:`step-2`.
